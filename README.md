## Demonstration

This plugin is an extension of the Typewriter plugin. On one hand, we have the typewriter plugin which types the given string with the same time difference in character which is stated by the user. Whereas TypeIt creates a much more realistic time delay between the character. These delays are random thus making it feel like a human is typing a text, not a robot.

As you can see in the above demonstration of the TypeIt plugin there are no fixed time intervals between the characters. This is more like us humans as we usually think while typing and the delay between different characters vary according to the person typing it.
